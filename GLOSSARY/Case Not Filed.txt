Alternatively, if the Prosecuting Attorney's Office does not find the suspect guilty *beyond a reasonable doubt* following review of the evidence and facts of the case, it will decline to file charges in Court. Common reasons to decline filing charges include:
* Insufficient evidence to prove guilt *beyond a reasonable doubt*
* Referred to Other Jurisdiction
* Self-Defense
* **Pending Further Investigation** (prosecutor returns case to the submitting agency to gather additional evidence prior to making a filing decision)
