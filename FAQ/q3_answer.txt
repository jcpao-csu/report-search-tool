The Prosecuting Attorney’s Office must examine whether there is evidence of a person using force to protect themselves or another person to determine if charges can be filed because of Missouri’s use of force in defense of persons statute [RSMo 563.031](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=563.031). Once it is raised by a defendant, Missouri law places the burden on the prosecution to disprove a self-defense or defense of others claim beyond a reasonable doubt through admissible evidence. This means that if the available evidence is unclear or favors the defendant, a conviction would be unlikely, and a prosecutor should refrain from filing charges consistent with the applicable ethical and legal rules.
