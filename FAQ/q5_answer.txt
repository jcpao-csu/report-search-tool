The Prosecuting Attorney’s Office has a legal and ethical obligation to prove all aspects of a case beyond a reasonable doubt in order to file charges. The legal standard "beyond a reasonable doubt" is the highest burden of proof in the legal system and is required for a criminal conviction. It means that the evidence must be so convincing that there is no reasonable doubt in the mind of a rational person that the defendant committed the crime. This standard does not require absolute certainty, but it does mean that jurors or a judge must be firmly convinced of the defendant’s guilt based on the evidence presented.
