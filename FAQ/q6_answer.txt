The Prosecuting Attorney’s Office is committed to supporting victims throughout the legal process. Consistent with the victim’s rights law [RSMo 595.209](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=595.209), a dedicated victim advocate will be assigned to a charged case to keep the victim(s) informed about case developments and court proceedings. Our advocates are here to provide emotional support, guidance, and connections to social services that can help with counseling, and other essential resources. When necessary, our advocates will work with law enforcement and other relevant stakeholders to assist with safety planning. We understand that this can be a difficult time, and our goal is to ensure that victims feel supported, heard, and empowered every step of the way.
