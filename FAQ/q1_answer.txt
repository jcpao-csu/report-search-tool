The Prosecuting Attorney’s Office carries the burden of proof to establish every element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. If the admissible evidence does not support the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, the charges cannot be filed legally or ethically. See [ABA STANDARDS FOR PROSECUTION FUNCTION 3-4.3(a) (2015); MO. SUP. CT. R. 4-3.8(a)](https://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=198937). Thus, before filing charges, the Prosecuting Attorney’s Office must evaluate whether available evidence – such as witness statements, physical evidence, forensic reports, and surveillance footage – is strong enough to support a conviction in court. Pursuing charges without strong evidence risks an unjust prosecution, the possibility of an acquittal, and the misuse of judicial resources. Therefore, when the evidence is insufficient to establish a likelihood of a conviction, a prosecutor has an ethical and legal duty to decline to file charges.
